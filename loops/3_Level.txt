1 - Iterate 0 to 10 using for loop, do the same using while and do while loop
2 - Iterate 10 to 0 using for loop, do the same using while and do while loop
3 - Iterate 0 to n using for loop
4 - Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only even numbers
5 - Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only odd numbers
6 - Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all numbers.
    The sum of all numbers from 0 to 100 is 5050.
7 - Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all evens and the sum of all odds.
    The sum of all evens from 0 to 100 is 2550. And the sum of all odds from 0 to 100 is 2500.
8 - Develop a small script which generate array of 5 random numbers
9 - Write a script which generates a random hexadecimal number.
    ex: '#ee33df'
10 - Write a script which generates a random rgb color number.
    rgb(240,180,80)
